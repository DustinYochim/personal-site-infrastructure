Infrastructure as Code (Terraform and Ansible) for my personal site.

## What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp that allows users to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure and services using a high-level configuration language (HCL) or JSON. It is used to automate the setup, scaling, and management of infrastructure resources across various cloud providers and services.
